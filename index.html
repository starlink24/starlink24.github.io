<p>Great grey owls can find and capture voles hidden beneath almost two feet of snow, punching through hardened crusts with their legs to snag a meal. Now researchers have uncovered hints of how these birds of prey use sound to accomplish such an impressive feat.

The new study, published November 22 in the Proceedings of the Royal Society B, suggests the owls hover over the snow to locate muffled sounds, and that their broad faces help with this task.

“Snow is really famous for absorbing sound,” says study leader Christopher Clark, an ornithologist at the University of California, Riverside, who ran a series of experiments measuring sound in Manitoba, Canada, earlier this year.

Researchers have previously thought that the hunters zero in on rodents’ ultrasonic vibrations. But the new experiments suggest owls could also be picking up lower-pitched sounds, for instance those created by voles digging tunnels under the snow.

Though people often think owls’ ears are on top of their heads, they’re actually closer to the centre of their face, which is fringed by a ring of sound-reflecting feathers that funnel sounds toward their ears. (Read about a new owl species found with a haunting screech.)

The bigger an owl’s facial disc, the lower the frequency of sound it can intercept—and the great grey owl, found throughout the Northern Hemisphere, has the biggest facial disc of any owl, Clark says.

“Probably what’s going on is that the facial disc is really big to make them more sensitive to low-frequency sound.”

Snowbound
In February 2022, Clark and colleagues traveled to the forests of Manitoba and located seven newly made plunge holes, which are created by an owl diving into the snow after its prey.

Next to each hole, they dug another, where they placed a speaker. Because of the frigid temperatures—one day was -30 degrees Celsius—the team had to contend with technology failing from the cold. “It was exhilarating work to do in the sense that stuff kept going wrong due to the weather,” Clark says.

Next the team used an acoustic camera, which has an array of microphones, to record the various noises in the environment. From the buried speakers, they then played white noise, a high-frequency sound, and recordings of a burrowing vole, a low-frequency sound. (Read about the world’s biggest owl, an endangered species.)

By removing layers of snow atop the speaker, the team recorded how the depth of snow affected sound frequencies. For instance, data from the acoustic camera revealed that while much of the white noise could escape some eight inches of snow, only the lower-frequency sounds could pass through a 20-inch-deep layer—exactly the sounds that the owls may be detecting.

Acoustic mirage
Next, Clark and colleagues investigated a tricky effect that owls must contend with: the acoustic mirage.

The paths of sound waves from beneath the snow bend when they hit the snow’s surface. Unless an owl is directly above its prey, this bending, called refraction, causes the location where the sound seems come from to differ from its actual origin.

“It’s the same problem we have when we try and pick up things underwater,” says Megan Gall, a sensory ecologist at Vassar College in Poughkeepsie, New York, who wasn’t involved with the study. 

SILENT SNOWY OWL ATTACK
A snowy owl hunts in utter silence – and her unsuspecting prey will never know what hit it! Footage from the show "Alaska's Deadliest".
The acoustic camera data showed that where a sound seems to come from depends on the hearer’s height above the snow, their horizontal distance to the sound, and the sound’s depth.

When great grey owls hunt, they tend to fly or glide toward their prey, and, once they’re in the vicinity of a vole, hover overhead for up to 10 seconds, Clark says. Hovering likely allows the owls home in on a spot that minimizes the acoustic mirage.

“That’s probably the critical point for them to listen and pinpoint where the vole is,” says Clark.

Silent swoopers
“It’s a fantastic first step in understanding what is happening to the sound,” Gall says.

But she adds there’s a lot to learn, particularly from the owls’ point of view. Future experiments could investigate how the avian predators respond to sounds played from beneath the snowpack. Or, scientists could even train birds to attack and watch if their hunting accuracy changes when sounds are manipulated, Gall says. (Take our poll and pick your favorite superb owl.)

Hermann Wagner, a retired neuroethologist who also wasn’t involved in the new work, notes that the owls’ ability to locate prey at such depths is “remarkable.”

The new research, he says, reinforces how great grey owls seem to use quiet to their advantage. For instance, structures on the owls’ wings prevent them from making noisy flaps that would drown out the sounds of their prey, Wagner says.

“What the owl does is it becomes more or less silent so that it can hear much better.”

New owl species found—and it has a haunting screech
Living only in the old-growth forests of Príncipe Island off the coast of west Africa, the tiny bird is likely already critically endangered, experts say.

Just off Africa’s western coast, there’s a small island known as Príncipe where strange screeches haunt the night.

Not many people have heard the noises, which emanate from the old-growth forests on the southern, uninhabited part of the island. They start just after sunset and sometimes sound like the rasp of an insect, the mewling of a cat, or perhaps the call of a monkey. Locals first noted the squawks back in 1928, but without the means to easily see into the towering forest canopy at night, the sounds have become an enigma.

Today, the mysterious noisemaker has been identified once and for all as a new species of tiny yellow-eyed owl, according to a study published in the journal ZooKeys.

Known officially as the Principe scops-owl, or Otus bikegila, the raptor is one of 59 species of scops-owl: small, brownish, perch-and-pounce predators found all over the world. So far, scientists know little about the nocturnal O. bikegila, such as what it eats, how it hunts, or the meanings of its unusual sounds.

“This is what we call an integrative study, because it’s kind of like a puzzle,” says study co-author Bárbara Freitas, an evolutionary biologist at the Spanish National Museum of Natural Sciences in Madrid.

“We have multiple pieces, like the owl’s vocalisations, its morphology, and its genetics, and then we can put together all the data and see if it was actually new,” says Freitas, who is also a National Geographic Explorer.

While there are thought to be between a thousand to 1,500 individuals of the newly described species, the scientists believe the owl’s entire range encompasses only about five square miles within Príncipe Obô Natural Park. Príncipe is one of the islands that make up the country of Sao Tome and Principe. 

“We think that it is completely dependent on that native forest,” says Freitas. “It’s already a protected area, but it can be damaged so easily.” (Read about the world’s biggest owl, an endangered species.)

For instance, a small hydroelectric dam is currently scheduled to be built nearby that could lead to deforestation in the area, says Freitas.

For these reasons, in another newly published study in the journal Bird Conservation International, the scientists recommend that the owl be further protected with a critically endangered status by the International Union for Conservation of Nature.

Former parrot catcher on a mission
While the existence of the Príncipe scops-owl had been suspected for nearly a century, the species may have never been officially found and described if not for a local guide named Ceciliano do Bom Jesus, or as everyone there knows him, Bikegila.

Long before Príncipe Obô Natural Park was established in 2006, Bikegila—whose nickname has no particular origin—was one of many men who made a living climbing into the canopy to snatch African grey parrot chicks out of their nests and sell them into the pet trade.

After the area was protected and parrot harvesting was outlawed, Bikegila turned his expansive knowledge of the landscape toward another purpose—guiding. In fact, Bikegila was one of the first people to first spot the owl while searching for parrot chicks in the early 1990s. 

For nearly a quarter century, he’s assisted scientists on every expedition undertaken to find the owl, including the trip that led to the first-ever photographic evidence of the species, in July 2016. Then, on May 29, 2017, Bikegila and another study co-author, Hugo Pereira, of Portugal's University of Porto, caught one of the animals for the first time. 

This was the individual that scientists would use to describe the species, while later specimens were sampled and then released, their DNA helping to prove that the Principe scops-owl was distinct from other scops-owl species.

To honour the work of local guides worldwide, Freitas and her colleagues named the new owl after Bikegila, who is also a co-author on the study on its conservation threats.

When asked what he’d like the world to know about his island home, Bikegila turned the question back around.

“Why can’t they come here? You should tell them to come,” Bikegila, who speaks Portuguese, told National Geographic via translation by study leader Martim Melo, a biologist at the University of Porto. 

“They must see for themselves the landscape, the birds, the history, and then make their own judgment. It’s better this way.”

Listening for the next new species
Freitas and colleagues have also released a third study: A pre-print detailing their method for discovering the owl, called passive acoustic monitoring, which they think can be used to identify other new species in remote terrain.

To find the Príncipe owl in the dense forest, the team first deployed audio recorders to sample what animals were creating sounds in the darkness. They then analysed this data for the owl’s signature call—a short, repeated “tuu”—often performed in a duet, which the scientists had recorded from the wild.

Then, Freitas designed a computer program to sift through countless hours of audio recordings to identify the Principe scops-owl amid the din of parrots, insects, and other nightlife. 

“It’s the sound equivalent of camera-trapping, which of course is also very good at finding things that humans in habitat will miss,” says Nigel Collar, an African scops-owl expert at the nonprofit BirdLife International who was not involved in the new research. Collar has used acoustic monitoring to survey owls, but not to zero in on one species in the way the new paper describes.

"It’s very good to see this owl finally being described," adds Collar. "They have clearly done a very professional job."

The best thing about passive acoustic monitoring, says Freitas, is that scientists can continue to analyze and reanalyze those recordings based on what animals or sounds are of interest. Which means the same data could potentially be used to identify still more new species hiding out in the night.

“It’s really going to boost the knowledge we have now,” she says.

Stingrays recorded making sounds for the first time—but why is a mystery
New videos taken in Australia and Indonesia reveal at least two stingray species make clicking noises—but it's unknown how they do it.

Whales sing, shrimp snap, and toadfish hum. But the stingray? Until recently, scientists believed the flat fish to be quiet as a pancake.

Now, a study has broken that silence. Videos reveal that two species of stingray—the mangrove whipray (Urogymnus granulatus) and cowtail stingray (Pastinachus ater), both native to the Indo-West Pacific—produce striking, unmistakable clicks.

In fact, in one of the videos, the stingray’s click was so boisterous, it caused the photographer to drop his camera, says Lachlan Fetterplace, a marine ecologist at the Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences who led the study, published recently in the journal Ecology.

While nearly a thousand species of bony fish make some sort of noise, sharks, rays, and skates had, until now, been thought of as silent outliers. And that’s surprising, because scientists and divers are in the water with these animals all the time.

“That’s kind of the strange thing,” Fetterplace says. “I dive a lot with some other species of rays, and now I’m second guessing myself. Could I have missed this?”

“This just shows we don’t know everything,” he adds. “We’re in the year 2022, and you can discover something no one has ever seen just by going out and doing observations in natural history.”

How does a stingray make a sound?
Before the new study, the only verified evidence of rays making sounds came from a study of captive cownose rays. Published in 1970, this research recorded short, sharp clicks coming from the fish, but only after scientists forcefully prodded them. It wasn’t until 2017 and 2018 that several of the new study’s co-authors happened to record high-quality video while diving in Indonesia and Australia that captured the noises. 

Even though the video evidence these rays make noises seems to be a slam dunk, the researchers are not certain how the animals produce the sounds.

“They don’t have vocal cords, and there’s no clear mechanism for how they do it,” Fetterplace says.

In the videos, the rays’ spiracles—two holes on their heads used to move water across their gills—appear to contract as the clicking sound is heard. This suggests the fish might be creating friction between the spiracles and the surrounding tissue, not unlike when we snap our fingers. It’s also possible the rays are forming sounds by creating a vacuum, like when we click our tongues, Fetterplace explains.

Whatever is going on, it is likely to be revealed soon, as other scientists are already planning studies to look at ray anatomy more closely.

What are stingrays trying to say?
For their research, Fetterplace and his colleagues compared the bandwidth and frequencies of the sounds to the known range of stingray hearing. They confirmed stingrays can indeed hear these sounds, which could mean they’re a form of communication.

At the same time, the scientists’ work showed that reef sharks and sicklefin lemon sharks—predators of both ray species—can also hear the clicks. That suggests stingrays may issue the sounds when they sense a predator approaching as a warning, perhaps to stay away from the rays' venomous barbs.

Similarly, the quick, loud sounds may simply be a diversion that surprises a predator and gives the stingray a chance to escape. (Like how the clicks worked on that underwater photographer.)

There is another possibility, though.

When photographer and co-author Javier Delgado Esteban witnessed a wild mangrove whipray making sounds in 2018 in Geoffrey Bay, Australia, he noted another interesting behaviour. After making the clicks, the juvenile was quickly joined by a number of other stingrays. (See the enormous stingray that set the record for world’s largest freshwater fish.)

“The others would come in and pile around it, and all have their tails with spikes sticking up,” says Fetterplace, suggesting the clicks could be a way to call in reinforcements.

'Really, really exciting'
Audrey Looby, a doctoral candidate and marine community ecologist at the University of Florida, recently published a scientific review of noise-making in fish. She sifted through more than 800 references dating back to 1874 and found very few references to elasmobranchs, the group that includes sharks, rays, and skates. 

“So seeing a study come out like this, where there’s video and a comprehensive description of behaviours associated with those sounds, it’s just really, really exciting,” Looby says.

As to how this ability has gone overlooked for so long, Looby says it could be explained by any of several factors. For instance, perhaps stingrays make sounds occasionally, or only certain species can do it, or the fish are more likely to produce noise at a specific time or season. 

“They can also be quite difficult to study because they are often highly mobile and elusive,” says Looby.

Because many species of stingray are threatened with extinction, Fetterplace offers a word of caution. While he and his co-authors hope their research will uncover more examples of sound-producing stingrays, “we don’t want the public to go out and get really close to a ray just to get this sort of noise.”

“That’s not good for the ray,” he says, “and it’s potentially dangerous.”</p>
